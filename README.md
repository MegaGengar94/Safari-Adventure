# Safari-Adventure

This is the Safari Adventure! Here you can find valueble reasources, Meet helpful friends, and possibly find treasure. The higher the difficulty of the area the mosre valueable reasource.

There are 4 areas to explore and once you go into an area, up to three events will happen once you choose an area and the amount of points you get is dependant on the event

The events that can happen are resouces, people, treasure, danger, hazard, and harmless. resources, people and treasure give a certain amount of points depending on what goes down in those events. danger and hazard take away points although danger can reduce the amount of points lost if you type 'run' when prompted. Harmless does nothing and is a wasted event. Every area has at least one of these catagories.

If you manage to get at least 100 points before the 5 days are up, You win. Otherwise you lose, good luck.
